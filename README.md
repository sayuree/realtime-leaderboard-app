# Real-Time Leaderboard Backend System

## Project Description
This project involves creating a backend system for a real-time leaderboard service. The service will allow users to compete in various games or activities, track their scores, and view their rankings on a leaderboard. The system will feature user authentication, score submission, real-time leaderboard updates, and score history tracking. Redis sorted sets will be used to manage and query the leaderboards efficiently.

## Project Requirements
You are to build an imaginary real-time leaderboard system that ranks users based on their scores in various games or activities. The system should meet the following requirements:

### Core Features
- **User Authentication**: Users should be able to register and log in to the system.
- **Score Submission**: Users should be able to submit their scores for different games or activities.
- **Leaderboard Updates**: Display a global leaderboard showing the top users across all games.
- **User Rankings**: Users should be able to view their rankings on the leaderboard.
- **Top Players Report**: Generate reports on the top players for a specific period.

### Technical Implementation
- **Leaderboard Storage**: Use Redis sorted sets to store and manage leaderboards.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Utilize Redis sorted sets for efficient real-time updates and queries.
- **Rank Queries**: Use Redis commands to query user ranks and leaderboard positions.

> **Tip**: Redis Sorted Sets are particularly well-suited for this type of application due to their O(log(N)) time complexity for score updates and ranking operations.
